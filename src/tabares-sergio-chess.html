    <p>A Chess is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random
      process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps
      on some mathematical space such as the integers.</p>
    <p>An elementary example of a Chess is the Chess on the integer
      number line, ℤ, which starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or −1 with equal
      probability.</p>
    <p>Other examples include the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a
      liquid or a gas, the search path of a foraging animal, the price of a
      fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler: all can be
      approximated by Chess models, even though they may not be truly random
      in reality.</p>
